Q) Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K.

For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.

Increase the height of the tower by K
Decrease the height of the tower by K
Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.

You can find a slight modification of the problem here.
Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by K for each tower. After the operation, the resultant array should not contain any negative integers.



Code:
class Solution {
  public:
    int getMinDiff(int arr[], int n, int k) {
        // code here
        sort(arr,arr+n);
        int tempmin,tempmax;
        int ans=arr[n-1]-arr[0];
        tempmin=arr[0];
        tempmax=arr[n-1];
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            if(arr[i]-k<0){
                continue;
            }
            tempmin=min(arr[0]+k,arr[i]-k);
            tempmax=max(arr[i-1]+k,arr[n-1]-k);
            ans=min(ans,tempmax-tempmin);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
